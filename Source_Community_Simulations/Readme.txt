Scripts contained within this folder correspond to simulations analysing the effect of distribution of fitness effects and paramater choices on UTEM community dynamics. 

Note that the set of simulations is less extensive than for the invasion simulations and the data structure is less efficient. The c++ scripts are simpler and so can be seen as a starting point for simulations of the model dynamics without invasions.
