# Vilaetal2019

This repository contain the datafiles and scripts for Vilaetal2019

Methods used to obtain this data are outlined in the the paper.

All scripts and data are stored in this folder.

Invasion Simulations were conducted using C++/Invasion_Additive.cpp. The script is designed to be run a cluster and take an integer number between 1-450 as an argument. Different sets of simulations will be conducted depending on which integer number is provided. Simulations were run with a wall time of 72 hr.

The raw results outputed from this scripst are extremely large (~30gb) and are available upon requests. Data was converted into a tractable data.table using R/Data_Processing.R.  The final data.table is stored as R/Summary_Data.csv which gives the  snapshot data for each invasion run which is all that we need for most of the analysis. Timeseries data needed for Figure 2 and figure 6D are provided as csv files in the R/Timeseries folder. Experimental data used in Figure 6A and 6C is contained in R/Acosta.csv and R/Jousset.csv.

Figures 2-6 can be generated by running  R/Paper_Figures.R
Figures S1-S5 can be  generated by running R/Paper_Supplementary_Figures.R

Scripts used to simulate the source community with alternative distributions of mutational effect are found in Source_Community_Simulations/C++. 
The results for simulations are stored as csv files in Source_Community_Simulations/R.
The files in this folder contain results for simulations with paramaters J = 10000, u = 0.0001, s = 0.01 except for DFE_Simulations.csv which is carried out using a range of paramaters.
Figures S6-S7 Can be genrated by running Source_Community_Simulations/R/Paper_Supplementary_Figures2.R
